Patches for the [Rebel Technology OWL](https://www.rebeltech.org/) by Andi McClure <<andi.m.mcclure@gmail.com>>. Patches were tested with the [Magus](https://www.rebeltech.org/product/magus/) and some of them use the screen. There is also a PC-side test harness.

Build instructions in [run.txt](run.txt). Or you can paste the .hpp files into [the RebelTech patches website](https://www.rebeltech.org/patch-library).
